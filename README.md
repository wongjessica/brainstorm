| Morningly | Your all-in-one, go to web application that helps get you ready for the morning. It's basically the application that you'll open once you wake up, giving you everything that you need for the morning. There will be extremely customizable widgets, basically, blocks/sections across the web application screen that will display necessities for your morning, for instance, the weather, your daily horoscope, a calendar (that maybe syncs to your Google Calendar), and there will also be a handy mini to-do list that will say something like "make coffee" (and give suggestions on further to-do tasks, like "Check emails"), the time, and maybe a section that will redirect to a website that will help you order your daily cup of coffee. | Getting up in the morning and having to go through too many apps to prepare. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XUKLPZgALuIgQQ1VnSi5fVhJP6Zob5ug46qwm_74ES4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> More information here. </a> | <a href="https://github.com/wongjessica/leaguesite" target="_blank"> Incomplete </a> |
